Given a Binary Tree of ***n*** nodes, ***find all the nodes that don't have any siblings.*** You need to return a list of integers containing all the nodes that don't have a sibling in ***sorted order*** (Increasing).

Two nodes are said to be ***siblings*** if they are present at the same level, and their parents are the same.

**Note:** The root node can not have a sibling so it cannot be included in our answer.
### ðŸ’¡Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>
      37
      /   
    20
    /     
  113 
<strong>Output:</strong> 
   20 113
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
  Nodes 20 and 113 dont have any siblings.
   
</pre>
### ðŸ’¡Example 2:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>
       1
      / \
     2   3 
<strong>Output:</strong>
  -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong>  
  Every node has a sibling.
</pre>
## Your Task:
  -  You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function ***noSibling()*** which takes the root of the tree as input parameter and returns a list of integers containing all the nodes that don't have a sibling in sorted order. If all nodes have a sibling, then the returning list should contain only one element -1.
## Expected Time Complexity:

```O(nlogn)```


## Expected Space Complexity: 
```O(Height of the tree)```

## Constraints: 
1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
